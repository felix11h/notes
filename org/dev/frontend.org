Angular - heavy-handed, but if you don’t need to go too far off the rails it can make a decent SPA

React - more lightweight than Angular, allows for a more simple development process if you wouldn’t benefit from the exact structure of Angular

Vue - the most lightweight, components are even more self-contained than in the other solutions which can be great for reusability

** differential loading
for each browser, always load the smallest javascript bundle based on what features are available in that browser

** lazy loading
do not (yet) load javascript for components (app features) that are not needed yet
