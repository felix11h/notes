REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these criteria:

 - A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP.
 - Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests and each request is separate and unconnected.

* idempotent
In the context of REST APIs, when making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request â€“ then that REST API is called idempotent.

- simple structures
- straightforward caching possible
