* Dealing with Gaps

** Transpiler

Convert newer language syntax like

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
if (something) {
    let x = 3;
    console.log(x);
}
else {
    let x = 4;
    console.log(x);
}
#+END_SRC

to syntax that is compatible with older versions of the language (since JS is not forward compatible), like 

#+BEGIN_SRC js
var x$0, x$1;
if (something) {
    x$0 = 3;
    console.log(x$0);
}
else {
    x$1 = 4;
    console.log(x$1);
}
#+END_SRC

Popular choice for JS transpiler: [[https://babeljs.io/][babeljs.io]].

** Polyfill ("shim")


* Test

(test)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
x = b
print("hello world")
#+END_SRC
